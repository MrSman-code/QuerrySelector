    <h1>Isaac Newton's Queries</h1>
    <p>
      <span class="doth">Doth</span> not the Refraction of Light proceed from
      the different density of this athereal Medium in different places, the
      Light receding always from the denser parts of the Medium? And is not the
      density thereof greater in free and open Spaces void of Air and other
      grosser Bodies, than within the Pores of Water, Glass, Crystal, Gems, and
      other compact Bodies? For when Light passes through Glass or Crystal, and
      falling very obliquely upon the farther Surface thereof is totally
      reflected, the total Reflexion ought to proceed rather from the density
      and vigour of the Medium without and beyond the Glass, than from the
      rarity and weakness thereof. <br />
      Is not this Medium much rarer within the dense Bodies of the Sun, Stars,
      Planets and Comets, than in the empty celestial Spaces between them? And
      in passing from them to great distances, <span class="doth">doth</span> it
      not grow denser and denser perpetually, and thereby cause the gravity of
      those great Bodies towards one another, and of their parts towards the
      Bodies; every Body endeavouring to go from the denser parts of the Medium
      towards the rarer?
